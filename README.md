# Automatic Ticket Classification

## Project Description

This project implements an automatic ticket classification system. The goal is to automatically categorize incoming support tickets based on their content. This automation helps streamline the support process by directing tickets to the appropriate teams or individuals, reducing response times and improving overall efficiency.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:

*   **Automate Ticket Routing:** Automatically assign incoming tickets to the correct categories or departments.
*   **Reduce Manual Effort:** Minimize the manual effort required to sort and categorize tickets.
*   **Improve Response Times:** Enable faster response times by quickly routing tickets to the appropriate resolvers.
* **Enhance Efficiency:** Optimizes the ticket resolution workflow.

## How to Use

1.  **Run the Notebook:** Open and run the `Automatic_Ticket_Classification.ipynb` notebook.
2. **Training the Model:** The notebook contains the necessary steps to train a machine learning model for ticket classification using your data. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook.
3. **Predicting:** Once the model is trained, it can be used to automatically classify new incoming tickets based on their content. The notebook will also demonstrate how to use the trained model for the predictions.
